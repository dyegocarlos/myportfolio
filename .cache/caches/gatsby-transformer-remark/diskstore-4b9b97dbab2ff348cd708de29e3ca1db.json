The mobile app was developed in React Native with Styled Components and was projected from zero. By the mobile app the doctor can: see news from his area; see results or which process step a exam is in; contact scientific assessory, sell and administrative teams.</p>\n<p>I implemented the Design Sprint as a fast method of double diamond process of design thinking. I interviewed doctors, biomedicals and managers to understand the process of communication. Then I elicitate requirements and priorize them. After that I prototyped in AdobeXD and validate with stakeholders. Finally, I coded the front-end in React Native and presented to stakeholders again.</p>"}
