The Website has a responsive version with many landing pages for main exams, like covid tests, breast cancer and others. Now is possible the user buy a genetic test by the ecommerce integrated into the website. I interviewed employees, doctors and give some users informations from Hotjar. Benchmarks and competitor analysis was done frequently. I prototyped all screens at Adobe XD. I comunicated the user and company needs to the programmer and managed the activities in Scrum Sprints of a week. For the front-end, I worked with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery in Django templates.</p>"}
