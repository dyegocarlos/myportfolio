The Website has a responsive version. I interviewed employees, doctors and give some informations from Hotjar. Benchmarks and competitor analysis was done frequently. I prototyped all screens in Fireworks and then in Adobe XD. I comunicated the user and company needs to the programmer and managed the activities in Scrum Sprints of a week.
