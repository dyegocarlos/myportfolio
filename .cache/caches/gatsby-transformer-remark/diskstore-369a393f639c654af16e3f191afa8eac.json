Now is possible the user buy a genetic test by the ecommerce integrated into the website.</p>\n<p>there is no mobile app or content management system. While I was there, I designed and developed all the front-end of all the products of the lab including the responsive website, websystems and mobile apps. In the main website, you can navigate and access all of other products and projects that I projected and coded the front-end there. My activities was since ux research until front-end development. So, I interviewed user, prototyped wireframes and layouts, and developed front-end, sometimes with only HTML5, CSS3 and JS, sometimes with jQuery, React Native, Bootstrap and others technologies, depending on the needs.</p>"}
