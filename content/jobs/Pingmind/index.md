- Pingmind was a general MOOC platform for recorded courses.
- Initially, I was called to make a review in the interface analysing the differences between the implemented front-end and the UI design. I analysed that using Heuristic Evaluation and Ergonomics Criteria.
- In a second moment, I implemented the front-end in HTML5 and CSS3.
