- PyCursos was a specific MOOC platform for recorded Python courses, but it also had live events and courses. I designed the entire platform in fireworks and implemented the front-end in pure HTML5 and CSS3. One of this courses was <a style="text-decoration:underline" href="https://www.pycursos.com/python-para-zumbis/">Python for Zombies</a>, which was one of the python course with biggest quantity of students of Brazil.
- There was many courses, hangouts and content about the Python universe. For this project I use a framework for responsive grid and some human interaction and user experience technics, such as: brainstorm, benchmark, focus group (with courses tutors), wireframe, UI/visual design and front-end development.
