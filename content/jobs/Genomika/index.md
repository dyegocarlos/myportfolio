- My activities was since ux research until front-end development of all products of the lab, including the responsive website, websystems and mobile apps.
- I interviewed users, prototyped wireframes, draw layouts and developed front-end, sometimes with pure HTML5, CSS3 and JS, sometimes with jQuery, React Native, Bootstrap and others technologies, depending on the needs.
- I interacted with multiple kinds of teams, because I have needed to understand the needs of the users (which could be a doctor, a biomedic or a receptionist) and link this with the needs of the company (that demanded interviewed and meetings with directors and marketing teams).
