- Pingmind was a general MOOC platform for recorded courses. 
- Initially I was called to make a review in the interface analysing the differences between the implemented front-end and the UI design.
- In a second moment, I implemented the front-end in HTML5 and CSS3.
- Heuristic Evaluation, Ergonomics Criteria, HTML5, CSS3, JS
