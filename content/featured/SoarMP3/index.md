The Soar is a text to audio conversor. A tool to help students, workers with a big quantity of texts to read, and anyone that need or prefer to listen than to read a text. My work in this job started with the tool concept. In the first MVP, I designed the logo, projected the interactions since wireframes until the front-end.

In the new Soar Voice, I collaborate developing the front-end in TailwindCSS and as a consultant with suggestions for business model and design interaction.
