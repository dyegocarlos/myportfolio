Initially, the partner system was made for only partners can solicitate tests for patients. This system was integrated to website for that end-users only could see the catalogue of exams.

When the covid19 pandemic starts, we adjusted this systems for all clients can purchase covid19 tests by a link from landing page in the website. The requirements changed as fast as possible, provided by the pandemic context. For example, in the first time the user only could schedule a exam for covid in a drive-through, in a second moment it didn't more necessary. 

<!-- Another adaptation from partner websystem was a negotiation module which the a partner, like a health plan representant could negotiate sales with the sales team of Genomika. For this system I create with the back-end developer a state machine to manage the process of negotiation. -->

Finally, rare genomes was a joint initiative of the Ministry of Health and the Albert Einstein Hospital through PROADI-SUS for the complete genome sequencing of individuals with rare diseases or hereditary cancer. For this system, we changed the colors and some specific informations from the ecommerce system. Before starts this project, I leader a team from Cesar Summer Jobs for build a module for the doctor fill the clinic data of the patient.
