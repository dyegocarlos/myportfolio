When I arrive in the company, the website was dark and doesn't have a integrated ecommerce. The Website has a responsive version with many landing pages for main exams, like [covid19 tests](https://www.genomika.com.br/covid19/), [hereditary cancer](https://www.genomika.com.br/testes-para-risco-hereditario-de-cancer/) and others. Now is possible the user buy a genetic test by the ecommerce integrated into the website.

I interviewed employees, doctors and give some users informations from Hotjar. Benchmarks and competitor analysis was done frequently. I prototyped all screens at Adobe XD. I comunicated the user and company needs to the programmer and managed the activities in Scrum Sprints of a week. For the front-end, I worked with HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery in Django templates.
